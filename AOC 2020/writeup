ADVENT OF CODE 2020 WRITEUP

This year I decided to do advent of code, which, for those unfamaiar, is a programming challenge the runs every december. It's bascially and advent calender but with coding problems each day. They start off easy 
and get progressively harder. Every day, two problems are released, and for each problem you complete you get a star. 25 days, 50 stars. My goal is to complete both problems each day, for the next 25 days.
Originaly I was going to use this to learn a new language (Common Lisp), but it december kind of snuck up on me and I didnt have time to start learning a new language for the event. So I decided to go with old reliable and do it in python. Anyways, here we go!


--PROBLEM 1--
Given a list of integers, find the two entries that sum to 2020 and then multiply those two numbers together.

So, the first challenge was pretty easy. This is my first time doing advent of code, so I had no idea what the starting diffucutly would be, but this is probably as easy as a 
problem could get. I'm probably speaking too soon though, becuase this will probably get A LOT harder. Hopefully I will be able to do all 50 challenges, but I'm unsure, yet slightly optimistic. 
Anyways, here is my code for the first problem:

with open ('input.txt','r') as file:
    data = [int(i) for i in file]
    
for num in data:
    target = 2020-num
    if target in data:
        answer1 = num*target
        print(answer1)
        break

It's pretty self explanatory. For each number, find what other number adds to it to sum to 2020, then check if that number is in the list. If it is, the multiply them and there ya go.

Heres the answer: *spoiler*788739*spoiler*
**PROBLEM 2**
The same as problem 1, but this time find the 3 integers that add to 2020

For this problem, I just used my second solution from part 1, and added a third loop. Not the most efficent answer, but it works. 

for num1 in data:
    for num2 in data:
        for num3 in data:
            if num1 + num2+num3 == 2020:
                answer2 = num1*num2
print(answer2)
